# Guided-Meditation-Processing-project
This project falls under the visual art and animation type in the brief. The prototype consists of three separate files created using the software program Processing. Each file features a circle of the same size and a question prompt, but they differ in colour and the speed at which the circle grows and shrinks. As mentioned in the A1 project video, these differences were implemented to replicate various breathing meditations for users. The project also served as a challenge to understand how to perform this function effectively.

## General Information
The project intends to solve the issue in limited variations of guided meditations. 
Additionally, the challenge I set for myself was to learn a variety of coding techniques and learn the purpose and actions behind the finished product. This project has allowed me to do so  through problem-solving and researching how to get the circle to expand and contract, and understand code functions through text and animation.

## Technologies Used 
Processing version 4.3 (python)

## Setup
Need to have Processing installed and enable Sketch --> Present 

## Improvements 
- With more time and understanding the goal would be to input a question box allowing users to enter their responses and have the software store the data
- Adding the terms "Breathe In" and "breathe Out" to line up with the circle movement would also be a great feature to add. I didn't want to copy existing code without understanding it fully so I left it out of this project. Instead, I challenged myself with coding both visual and simple text. 

## Acknowledgements 
Thank you to my Tutor Mr John who offered guidance and advice throughout the project. Thank you to the Subject coordinator Dr Andrew Stapleton for the assessment information and weekly lectures that assisted with the direction of my prototype and helped me write my reflection.
